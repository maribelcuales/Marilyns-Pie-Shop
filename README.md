# Marilyns-Pie-Shop

This project uses Node, Express, and JavaScript to create a set of REST APIs needed to retrieve and modify a set of pies data.


## Project Objectives

The goal is to build a simple Node.js and Express Server. We will also create a set of endpoints for retrieving (GET), inserting (POST), updating (PUT), patching (PATCH), and deleting (DELETE) data from our Express server.
